# 0x0F. C - Function pointers #

This C project is designed to help you explore the fascinating world of function pointers and their practical applications. With a series of engaging tasks, you'll dive into the realm of C programming, enhancing your understanding of function pointers and their use cases.

**Print a Name:** In this task, you'll create a simple function that prints a name to the console. It may seem trivial, but it's an excellent way to get started with function pointers and understand their basic syntax.

**Execute a Function on Array Elements:** This task takes function pointers to the next level. You'll write a function that takes another function as a parameter and applies it to each element of an array. This is a powerful concept used in various real-world scenarios like data processing and manipulation.

**Search for an Integer:** Here, you'll create a function that searches for a specific integer within an array. You'll use function pointers to determine the search criteria, making your code more versatile and reusable.

**Perform Simple Operations:** In this task, you'll build a program that demonstrates how function pointers can be used for simple arithmetic operations.

**Print the Opcodes of the Main Function:** This task is a bit more advanced and exciting. You'll create a program that extracts and prints the opcodes (machine code instructions) of its own main function. This will showcase how function pointers can be used for introspection and analysis of your code.

Let's dive in and start your function pointer adventure!

Happy coding!
