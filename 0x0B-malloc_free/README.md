# 0x0B. C - malloc, free #

This project explores the fundamental concepts of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in the C programming language using malloc and free functions. It includes a series of tasks and code examples to help you understand how to allocate and release memory dynamically, manage memory effectively, and avoid memory leaks in your C programs.
The tasks include:

**Initialize Char Array:** Create a function to initialize a char array with a specific character.

**Copy String:** Implement a function to copy a given string into a newly allocated memory space.

**Concatenate Strings:** Write a function that concatenates two strings.

**Allocate 2D Array:** Develop a function that allocates memory for a 2-dimensional array of integers.

**Free 2D Grid:** Design a function to free memory allocated by the alloc_grid function.

**Concatenate Program Arguments:** Create a function to concatenate all arguments passed to your program.

**Split String into Words:** Develop a function to split a string into individual words.

Explore each task to enhance your C programming skills and gain proficiency in managing dynamic memory effectively.
