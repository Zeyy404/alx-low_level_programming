# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor #

In this project, we embark on a journey to unravel the secrets of C/C++ preprocessor magic, delve into object-like macros, and master preprocessor directives. It's a space where both beginners and seasoned programmers can explore and experiment with macros while having some coding fun.

**Object-like Macro:** We kick things off by creating a macro called SIZE – a shortcut to "1024".

**Pi:** Say hello to PI! We define a macro for 3.14159265359.

**File name:** Our code gets introspective and prints its own file name. Prepare to be amazed!

**Function-like macro:** ABS(x) – a macro that computes the absolute value of x – is our next challenge.

**SUM:** SUM(x, y) – a macro that effortlessly sums up two numbers.

Explore each task to enhance your C programming skills and unlock the power of macros.

Happy coding and macro-magic making!
