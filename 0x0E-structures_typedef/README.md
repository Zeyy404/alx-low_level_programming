# 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef #

Welcome to the Structures and Typedef Project! This project is your ticket to exploring the fundamental concepts of structures and typedef in the C programming language. Whether you're a budding programmer or a seasoned coder, this project offers a hands-on experience to grasp the power of custom data structures and type aliases in C.

## Dive into the Tasks ##
Here's a sneak peek at what lies ahead:

**Struct dog:** Define a new type, struct dog, to encapsulate dog-related information, and bring it to life.

**init dog**: Write a function that expertly initializes a struct dog variable with meaningful data.

**Print dog:** Create a function that artistically prints the delightful details of a struct dog.

**New type:** Introducing the magical dog_t type aliasâ€”making your code more elegant and readable.

**New dog:** Craft a function that gracefully creates new dogs using the simplicity of dog_t.

**Free dogs:** Finally, master the art of freeing memory allocated for our loyal canine friends, ensuring tidy resource management.

Let's embark on this journey of structures and typedef with enthusiasm and determination!
